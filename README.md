## ABOUT

`PupPromenade` aims to connect dog owners to dog walkers in New Yorks five bouroughs. Owners can search for walkers in their neighborhood, comparing recommendations, skills, experience, rates, and bios of individual walkers.

`PupPromenade` isn't simply a LinkedIn for dog walkers nor is it an AngiesList for dog owners. It's a management tool for owners and walkers that builds and establishes trust between walkers and owners. Walkers and owners can communicate through the app, keep track of individual walks, provide checkins at the beginning and end of the walk, and detailed analytics and descriptions of how the walk went.

Future iterations will include increased fucntionality of the above features as well as possible integration with FitBark.
